# Lesson 01 Step 03 — Your answers and suggested rewrites

Date: 2025-11-03

## Your original answers

1) "Version control is important since it can happen that when developing code we introduce bugs and need to go back to earlier versions of code that are bug free."

2) "An advantage of distributed version controll is that many more eyes overlook the process."

3) "When a group project happens in university and i am responsible for part A of the code but someone else sees that i made a mistake and requests a change and"

4) "because i can see all changes."

## Feedback (concise)

- Good work — you captured the main ideas. Your answers are correct but a little short in places. I expanded them to include important details and clearer phrasing.

## Suggested rewrites (clearer, slightly expanded)

1) Why version control is important

"Version control records changes so we can revert buggy code to a working version, see who changed what and when, and safely experiment using branches."

2) Advantages of a distributed VCS (like Git)

"A distributed VCS gives every user a full copy of the repository and history, so people can work offline, branch and merge locally, and share changes without relying on a single central server. It also makes branching and merging cheap and fast."

3) Collaboration scenario (complete)

"In a university group project I'm responsible for module A. A teammate finds a bug and opens an issue or pull request. I create a branch, make the fix, commit with a clear message, push the branch, and open a pull request so others can review and merge. The history records what changed and who fixed it, and it's easy to revert if needed."

4) How version control helps track history

"Version control records every commit (with author, timestamp and message) and lets you view diffs between commits, so you can inspect who changed what and when, and revert changes if necessary. Tools like `git log`, `git diff` and `git blame` help with this."

If you'd like, I can also commit this file and push it to the remote (it's currently local). Say "commit and push answers" to have me commit and push, or say "next step" to continue the course (Lesson 01 Step 04).
